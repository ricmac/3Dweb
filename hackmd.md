# Creating an avatar

Following Jin's [getting-started guide](https://github.com/M3-org/git-gud). 

I've already created a few avatars in [Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me/hub/avatars). I've used one in Mozilla Hubs.

I'd also created an avatar in VRoidStudio, seen here via [VRoid Hub](https://hub.vroid.com/).
